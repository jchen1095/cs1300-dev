        <h1>Competitive Comparison Chart Discovery Summary</h1>
        <p>I compared Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and Letterboxd for its "Watchlist" functionality relative to each other. This was an interesting undertaking as all three websites had different features and implementations for using watchlists.</p>
        <p>From my observations, it seems that watchlists can be used to store media that are interesting to users so that they can better remember and keep track of movies or TV shows that they want to watch. This aspect is closely linked with other functionalities of the websites, such as the media cards' </p>
