        <h1>Competitive Comparison Chart Discovery Summary</h1>
        <p>I compared Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and Letterboxd for its "Watchlist" functionality relative to each other. This was an interesting undertaking as all three websites had different features and implementations for using watchlists.</p>
        <p>From my observations, it seems that watchlists can be used to store media that are interesting to users so that they can better remember and keep track of movies or TV shows that they want to watch. This aspect is closely linked with other functionalities of the websites, such as the media display cards</p>
        <p>Since these functionalities are closely linked, the Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb's "add to watchlist" button was very useful as it was a distinct button under every medica card that looks clickable and therefore makes it more intuitive to add new media to the watchlist. However, navigating to the watchlist on the Rotten Tomatoes website was more difficult than others 
            as you have to first navigate to your profile ansd then find your watchlist, whereas other websites have the watchlist explicitly linked as one of the pages in the navigation bar. IMDb's watchlist page in the navigation bar even includes a number count of how many movies/TV shows you have 'saved.' On the Letterboxd website, one has to hover over the medica card for the "add to watchlist" functionality 
            short-cut to appear, and even then this is a bit confusing as you are only shown some icons (an eye, a heart, and an option for more choices). These icons are a bit ambiguous and confusing and less successful than the other websites' "add to watchlist" buttons.
        </p> 
        <p>Moreover, both Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb offer "watch trailer" shortcut buttons on the media cards which are useful in deciding whether or not to add the media to your watchlist.</p>
        <p>In summary, having explicit, 'clickable' buttons for 'adding to list' for the favoriting function is successful in guiding the user to have a smooth experience using the watchlist. Moreover, explicitly showing the 'favorite list' on the navigation bar is also important for users to access and edit their favorites list quickly and smoothly.</p>

        <h1>App Purpose</h1>
        <p>This app is a garden planning tool and plant shop that lists different plant seeds that can be purchased. Users can also 'add' these seeds/plants to a wishlist to better organize their gardening. Plants can be sorted based on effort-to-grow or price. Users may also filter the plant list by region or season in which they are interested in planting in. The aggregation of items is manifest in the wishlists that users can create, ideally for different seasons of the year or for different kinds of gardens (for example, flower gardens vs fruit/vegetable gardens). </p>
